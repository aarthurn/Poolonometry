# Poolonometry üé±üìê

A trigonometry learning tool disguised as a pool game! Practice your trigonometric ratios while playing either 8-ball or 9-ball pool.  Try current version at: https://aarthurn.github.io/Poolonometry/

## Features

- **Two Game Modes**
  - 8-ball pool
  - 9-ball pool

- **Interactive Trigonometry Learning**
  - Work with all six trigonometric ratios (sin, cos, tan, csc, sec, cot)
  - Practice in all four quadrants
  - Visual coordinate grid system
  - Real-time angle visualization

- **Physics Simulation**
  - Realistic ball collisions
  - Adjustable friction
  - Power control
  - Pocket detection

- **Educational Tools**
  - Grid overlay for coordinate visualization
  - Angle analysis tools
  - Shot trajectory preview
  - Two-player turn system for collaborative learning

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aarthurn/Poolonometry.git
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser

## How to Play

1. **Select Game Mode**
   - Choose between 8-ball and 9-ball

2. **Plan Your Shot**
   - Select your trigonometric ratio (sin, cos, tan, csc, sec, cot)
   - Choose the ratio value
   - Select the quadrant
   - Adjust power and friction as needed

3. **Analyze and Shoot**
   - Use the "Analyze Path" button to preview your shot
   - Click "Shoot" to take your shot
   - Take turns with another player

## Controls

- **Ratio Selection**: Choose from sin, cos, tan, csc, sec, cot
- **Value Input**: Select from common values or enter a decimal
